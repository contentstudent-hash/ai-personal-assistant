## 6. AI RECOMMENDATIONS 💡

### What It Provides

The AI analyzes ALL your data and gives personalized advice on:

```
1. OPTIMIZING BAR EXAM PREP
   - Focus on Constitutional Law - your weakest area (2.8/5 clarity)
   - Increase study hours from 2h to 3h daily (trending shows you 
     improve more with 3h sessions)
   - Practice full essays weekly - your mock trend shows essays 
     dragging down your score
   - MBE trending at 68% (good) - maintain current approach

2. MANAGING WORK-LIFE BALANCE
   - Your morning study (8-10am) is most productive - protect this time
   - Evening studies (6pm-9:30pm) work well - continue high-intensity 
     study then
   - Work hours (11:30am-3/4pm) seem manageable - don't add more
   - Take full day off once per week (no Bar prep)

3. IMPROVING WEAK AREAS
   - Constitutional Law: Instead of general review, focus on 
     Due Process + Equal Protection (your 2 weakest topics)
   - Criminal Procedure: Do case-based practice, not just reading
   - Torts: Increase practice questions (you're at 60%, target 75%)

4. TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
   - Current: 2-2.5h daily on Bar = 14-17.5h/week. Target: 18-20h/week
   - Increase by 30 min daily on weak subjects
   - Batch-study similar subjects (Constitutional + Criminal Proc together)
   - Mock every 2 weeks + full exam every 4 weeks
```
